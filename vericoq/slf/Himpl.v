(** In the previous chapter, we have introduced the type [hprop] and the key
    operators over this type: [\[]], [\[P]], [p ~~> v], [H1 \* H2], [Q1 \*+ H2],
    and [\exists x, H].

    In order to state the reasoning rules of Separation Logic, we need to
    introduce the "entailment relation" on heap predicates. This relation,
    written [H1 ==> H2], asserts that any heap that satisfies [H1] also
    satisfies [H2]. We also need to extend the entailment relation to
    postconditions. We write [Q1 ===> Q2] to asserts that, for any result value
    [v], the entailment [Q1 v ==> Q2 v] holds.

    For example, the "consequence-frame rule", exploited by the tactic [xapp]
    for reasoning about every function call, is stated using entailements for
    pre- and postconditions. This rule explains how to derive a triple of the
    from [triple t H Q], knowing that the term [t] admits the specification
    [triple t H1 Q1]. There are two requirements: First, the precondition [H]
    must decompose into [H1], which denotes the precondition expected by the
    specification, and the remaining part, called [H2]. Second, the targeted
    postcondition [Q] must be a consequence of the conjunction of [Q1], which
    denotes the postcondition asserted by the specification, and [H2], which
    denotes the remaining part that has not been affected during the evaluation
    of the term [t]. The formal statement is as follows.

    Lemma triple_conseq_frame : forall H2 H1 Q1 t H Q,
      triple t H1 Q1 ->
      H ==> (H1 \* H2) ->
      (Q1 \*+ H2) ===> Q ->
      triple t H Q.

    This chapter presents:

    - the formal definition of the entailment relations, for heap predicates
      and for postconditions,
    - the lemmas capturing the interaction of entailment with the star operator,
    - the tactics [xsimpl] and [xchange] that are critically useful
      for manipulating entailments in practice.

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Definition of Entailment *)

(** The "entailment relationship" [H1 ==> H2] asserts that any heap [h] that
    satisfies the heap predicate [H1] also satisfies the heap predicate [H2]. *)

Definition himpl (H1 H2:hprop) : Prop :=
  forall (h:heap), H1 h -> H2 h.

Notation "H1 ==> H2" := (himpl H1 H2) (at level 55).

(** As we show next, the entailment relation is reflexive, transitive, and
    antisymmetric. It thus forms an order relation on heap predicates. *)

Lemma himpl_refl : forall H,
  H ==> H.
Proof using. intros h. hnf. auto. Qed.

Lemma himpl_trans : forall H2 H1 H3,

(** **** Exercise: 1 star, standard, especially useful (himpl_antisym)

    Prove the antisymmetry of entailment result shown below. Hint: use
    [predicate_extensionality]. *)

  (H1 ==> H2) ->
  (H2 ==> H1) ->
  H1 = H2.

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Entailment for Postconditions *)

(** The entailment relation can be used to capture that a precondition "entails"
    another one. We need a similar judgment to assert that a postcondition
    "entails" another one. For that purpose, we introduce the relation
    [Q1 ===> Q2], which asserts that for any value [v], the heap predicate
    [Q1 v] entails [Q2 v]. *)

Definition qimpl (Q1 Q2:val->hprop) : Prop :=
  forall (v:val), Q1 v ==> Q2 v.

Notation "Q1 ===> Q2" := (qimpl Q1 Q2) (at level 55).

(** In other words, [Q1 ===> Q2] holds if and only if, for any value [v] and any
    heap [h], the proposition [Q1 v h] implies [Q2 v h]. *)

(** Entailment on postconditions also forms an order relation: it is reflexive,
    transitive, and antisymmetric. *)

Lemma qimpl_refl : forall Q,
  Q ===> Q.
Proof using. intros Q v. apply himpl_refl. Qed.

Lemma qimpl_trans : forall Q2 Q1 Q3,
  (Q1 ===> Q2) ->

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Frame Rule for Entailment *)

(** A fundamental property is that the star operator is "monotone" with respect
    to entailment, meaning that if [H1 ==> H1'] then
    [(H1 \* H2) ==> (H1' \* H2)]. In other words, an arbitrary heap predicate
    [H2] can be "framed" on both sides of an entailment.

    Viewed the other way around, if we have to prove the entailment relation
    [(H1 \* H2) ==> (H1' \* H2)], we can "cancel out" [H2] on both sides. In
    this view, the monotonicity property is a sort of "frame rule for the
    entailment relation".

    Due to commutativity of star, it suffices to state the left version of the
    monotonicity property. *)

  (H1 \* H2) ==> (H1' \* H2).

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Introduction and Elimination Rules w.r.t. Entailments *)

(** The rules for introducing and eliminating pure facts and existential
    quantifiers in entailments are essential. They are presented next. *)

(** The first rule is captured by the lemma [himpl_hstar_hpure_r]. Consider an
    entailment of the form [H ==> (\[P] \* H')]. To establish this entailment,
    one must prove that [P] is true, and that [H] entails [H']. *)

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars, standard, especially useful (himpl_hstar_hpure_r).

    Prove the rule [himpl_hstar_hpure_r]. Hint: recall from [Hprop] the lemma
    [hstar_hpure_l], which asserts the equality [(\[P] \* H) h = (P /\ H h)]. *)

Lemma himpl_hstar_hpure_r : forall P H H',
  P ->
  (H ==> H') ->
  H ==> (\[P] \* H').
Proof using. (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.

(** [] *)

(** Reciprocally, consider an entailment of the form [(\[P] \* H) ==> H']. To
    establish this entailment, one must prove that [H] entails [H'] under the
    assumption that [P] is true. The "extraction rule for pure facts in the left
    of an entailment" captures the property that the pure fact [\[P]] can be
    extracted into the Coq context. It is stated as follows. *)

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars, standard, especially useful (himpl_hstar_hpure_l).

    Prove the rule [himpl_hstar_hpure_l]. *)

(** Consider an entailment of the form [H ==> (\exists x, J x)], where [x] has
    some type [A] and [J] has type [A->hprop]. To establish this entailment, one
    must exhibit a value for [x] for which [H] entails [J x]. *)

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars, standard, especially useful (himpl_hexists_r).

    Prove the rule [himpl_hexists_r]. *)

Lemma himpl_hexists_r : forall A (x:A) H J,

(** [] *)

(** Reciprocally, consider an entailment [(\exists x, (J x)) ==> H]. To
    establish this entailment, one has to prove that, whatever the value of [x],
    the predicate [J x] entails [H]. Indeed the former proposition asserts that
    if a heap [h] satisfies [J x] for some [x], then [h] satisfies [H'], while
    the latter asserts that if, for some [x], the predicate [h] satisfies [J x],
    then [h] satisfies [H'].

    The "extraction rule for existentials in the left of an entailment" captures
    the property that existentials can be extracted into the Coq context. It is
    stated as follows. Observe how the existential quantifier on the left of the
    entailment becomes an universal quantifier outside of the arrow. *)

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars, standard, especially useful (himpl_hexists_l).

    Prove the rule [himpl_hexists_l]. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Extracting Information from Heap Predicates *)

(** We next present an example showing how entailments can be used to state
    lemmas allowing to extract information from particular heap predicates.
    Concretely, we show that from a heap predicate of the form
    [(p ~~> v1) \* (p ~~> v2)] describes two "disjoint" cells that are both "at
    location [p]", one can extract a contradiction. Indeed, such a state cannot
    exist. The underlying contraction is formally captured by the following
    entailment relation, which concludes [False]. *)

Lemma hstar_hsingle_same_loc : forall (p:loc) (v1 v2:val),
  (p ~~> v1) \* (p ~~> v2) ==> \[False].

(** The proof of this result exploits a result on finite maps. Essentially, the
    domain of a single singleton map that binds a location [p] to some value is
    the singleton set [\{p}], thus such a singleton map cannot be disjoint from
    another singleton map that binds the same location [p].

    Check disjoint_single_single_same_inv : forall (p:loc) (v1 v2:val),
      Fmap.disjoint (Fmap.single p v1) (Fmap.single p v2) ->
      False.
*)

(** Using this lemma, we can prove [hstar_hsingle_same_loc] by unfolding the
    definition of [hstar] to reveal the contradiction on the disjointness
    assumption. *)

Proof using.
  intros. unfold hsingle. intros h (h1&h2&E1&E2&D&E). false.
  subst. eapply Fmap.disjoint_single_single_same_inv. eapply D.
Qed.

(** More generally, a heap predicate of the form [H \* H] is generally
    suspicious in Separation Logic. In the simple variant of Separation Logic
    that we consider in this course, there are only 3 typical situations where
    [H \* H] makes sense: (1) if [H] is the empty heap predicate [\[]], (2) If
    [H] is a pure heap predicate of the form [\P]], (3) if [H] of the form [
    \exists H0, H0], which will be written [\GC] in chapter [Affine]. *)

(* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Rules for Naming Heaps *)

(** Thereafter, we write [= h] as a shorthand for [fun h' => h' = h], that is,
    the heap predicate that only accepts heaps exactly equal to [h]. *)

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars, standard, optional (hexists_named_eq)

    Prove that a heap predicate [H] is equivalent to
    [\exists h, \[H h] \* (= h))]. Hint: use [hstar_hpure_l] and [hexists_intro]
    , as well as the extraction rules [himpl_hexists_l] and
    [himpl_hstar_hpure_l]. *)

(** ** The [xsimpl] Tactic *)

(** Performing manual simplifications of entailments by hand is an extremely
    tedious task. Fortunately, it can be automated using specialized Coq tactic.
    This tactic, called [xsimpl], applies to an entailment and implements a
    3-step process:

    - extract pure facts and existential quantifiers from the LHS,
    - cancel out equal predicates occurring both in the LHS and RHS,
    - generate subgoals for the pure facts occurring in the RHS, and instantiate
      the existential quantifiers from the RHS (using either unification variables
      or user-provided hints).

    These steps are detailed and illustrated next. *)

(* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** [xsimpl] to Extract Pure Facts and Quantifiers in LHS *)

(** The first feature of [xsimpl] is its ability to extract the pure facts and
    the existential quantifiers from the left-hand side out into the Coq
    context.

    In the example below, the pure fact [n > 0] appears in the LHS. After
    calling [xsimpl], this pure fact is turned into an hypothesis, which may be
    introduced with a name into the Coq context. *)

Lemma xsimpl_demo_lhs_hpure : forall H1 H2 H3 H4 (n:int),
  H1 \* H2 \* \[n > 0] \* H3 ==> H4.
Proof using.
  intros. xsimpl. intros Hn.

(** In case the LHS includes a contradiction, such as the pure fact [False], the
    goal gets solved immediately by [xsimpl]. *)

  H1 \* H2 \* \[False] \* H3 ==> H4.
Proof using.
  intros. xsimpl.
Qed.

(** The [xsimpl] tactic also extracts existential quantifier from the LHS. It
    turns them into universally quantified variables outside of the entailment
    relation, as illustrated through the following example. *)

Lemma xsimpl_demo_lhs_hexists : forall H1 H2 H3 H4 (p:loc),
  H1 \* \exists (n:int), (p ~~> n \* H2) \* H3 ==> H4.
Proof using.

(** A call to [xsimpl] extract at once all the pure facts and quantifiers from

Proof using.
  intros. xsimpl. intros n Hn Hp.
Abort.

(* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** [xsimpl] to Cancel Out Heap Predicates from LHS and RHS *)

(** The second feature of [xsimpl] is its ability to cancel out similar heap
    predicates that occur on both sides of an entailment.

    In the example below, [H2] occurs on both sides, so it is canceled out by
    [xsimpl]. *)

Lemma xsimpl_demo_cancel_one : forall H1 H2 H3 H4 H5 H6 H7,
  H1 \* H2 \* H3 \* H4 ==> H5 \* H6 \* H2 \* H7.
Proof using.

(** [xsimpl] actually cancels out at once all the heap predicates that it can
    spot appearing on both sides. In the example below, [H2], [H3], and [H4] are
    canceled out. *)

  H1 \* H2 \* H3 \* H4 ==> H4 \* H3 \* H5 \* H2.
Proof using.
  intros. xsimpl.
Abort.

(** If all the pieces of heap predicate get canceled out, the remaining proof
    obligation is [\[] ==> \[]]. In this case, [xsimpl] automatically solves the
    goal by invoking the reflexivity property of entailment. *)

Proof using.
  intros. xsimpl.
Qed.

(* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** [xsimpl] to Instantiate Pure Facts and Quantifiers in RHS *)

(** The third feature of [xsimpl] is its ability to extract pure facts from the
    RHS as separate subgoals, and to instantiate existential quantifiers from
    the RHS. Let us first illustrate how it deals with pure facts. In the
    example below, the fact [n > 0] gets spawned in a separated subgoal. *)

  H1 ==> H2 \* \[n > 0] \* H3.
Proof using.
  intros. xsimpl.
Abort.

(** When it encounters an existential quantifier in the RHS, the [xsimpl] tactic
    introduces a unification variable denoted by a question mark, that is, an
    "evar", in Coq terminology. In the example below, the [xsimpl] tactic turns
    [\exists n, .. p ~~> n ..] into [.. p ~~> ?x ..]. *)

(** The "evar" often gets subsequently instantiated as a result of a
    cancellation step. For example, in the example below, [xsimpl] instantiates
    the existentially quantified variable [n] as [?x], then cancels out
    [p ~~> ?x] from the LHS against [p ~~> 3] on the right-hand-side, thereby
    unifying [?x] with [3]. *)

Lemma xsimpl_demo_rhs_hexists_unify : forall H1 H2 H3 H4 (p:loc),
  H1 \* (p ~~> 3) ==> H2 \* \exists (n:int), (p ~~> n \* H3) \* H4.
Proof using.
  intros. xsimpl.
Abort.

(** The instantiation of the evar [?x] can be observed if there is another
    occurrence of the same variable in the entailment. In the next example,
    which refines the previous one, observe how [n > 0] becomes [3 > 0]. *)

Lemma xsimpl_demo_rhs_hexists_unify_view : forall H1 H2 H4 (p:loc),

Proof using.
  intros. xsimpl.
Abort.

(** (Advanced.) In certain situations, it may be desirable to provide an
    explicit value for instantiating an existential quantifier that occurs in
    the RHS. The [xsimpl] tactic accepts arguments, which will be used to
    instantiate the existentials (on a first-match basis). The syntax is
    [xsimpl v1 .. vn], or [xsimpl (>> v1 .. vn)] in the case [n > 3]. *)

Lemma xsimpl_demo_rhs_hints : forall H1 (p q:loc),
  H1 ==> \exists (n m:int), (p ~~> n \* q ~~> m).
Proof using.
  intros. xsimpl 8 9.
Abort.

(** (Advanced.) If two existential quantifiers quantify variables of the same
    type, it is possible to provide a value for only the second quantifier by
    passing as first argument to [xsimpl] the special value [__]. The following
    example shows how, on LHS of the form [\exists n m, ...], the tactic
    [xsimpl __ 9] instantiates [m] with [9] while leaving [n] as an unresolved
    evar. *)

Lemma xsimpl_demo_rhs_hints_evar : forall H1 (p q:loc),
  H1 ==> \exists (n m:int), (p ~~> n \* q ~~> m).
Proof using.

(** *** [xsimpl] on Entailments Between Postconditions *)

(** The tactic [xsimpl] also applies on goals of the form [Q1 ===> Q2].

    For such goals, it unfolds the definition of [===>] to reveal an entailment
    of the form [==>], then invokes the [xsimpl] tactic. *)

(** *** Example of Entailment Proofs using [xpull] and [xsimpl] *)

(** [xpull] is a simplified version of [xsimpl] that operates only the left-hand

(** [xsimpl] first invokes [xpull] to simplify the left-hand side, then attempts

(** ** The [xchange] Tactic *)

(** The tactic [xchange] is to entailment what [rewrite] is to equality. Assume
    an entailment goal of the form [H1 \* H2 \* H3 ==> H4]. Assume an entailment
    assumption [M], say [H2 ==> H2']. Then [xchange M] turns the goal into
    [H1 \* H2' \* H3 ==> H4], effectively replacing [H2] with [H2']. *)

Lemma xchange_demo_base : forall H1 H2 H2' H3 H4,
  H2 ==> H2' ->
  H1 \* H2 \* H3 ==> H4.
Proof using.
  introv M. xchange M.
  (* Note that freshly produced items appear to the front *)
Abort.

(** The tactic [xchange] can also take as argument equalities. The tactic
    [xchange M] exploits the left-to-right direction of an equality [M], whereas
    [xchange <- M] exploits the right-to-left direction . *)

Lemma xchange_demo_eq : forall H1 H2 H3 H4 H5,
  H1 \* H3 = H5 ->
  H1 \* H2 \* H3 ==> H4.
Proof using.
  introv M. xchange M.
  xchange <- M.
Abort.

(** The tactic [xchange M] does accept a lemma or hypothesis [M] featuring
    universal quantifiers, as long as its conclusion is an equality or an
    entailment. In such case, [xchange M] instantiates [M] before attemting to
    perform a replacement. *)

Lemma xchange_demo_inst : forall H1 (J J':int->hprop) H3 H4,
  (forall n, J n = J' (n+1)) ->
  H1 \* J 3 \* H3 ==> H4.
Proof using.
  introv M. xchange M.
  (* Note that freshly produced items appear to the front *)
Abort.

(** How does the [xchange] tactic work? Consider a goal of the form [H ==> H']
    and assume [xchange] is invoked with an hypothesis of type [H1 ==> H1'] as
    argument. The tactic [xchange] should attempt to decompose [H] as the star
    of [H1] and the rest of [H], call it [H2]. If it succeeds, then the goal
    [H ==> H'] can be rewritten as [H1 \* H2 ==> H']. To exploit the hypothesis
    [H1 ==> H1'], the tactic should replace the goal with the entailment
    [H1' \* H2 ==> H']. The lemma shown below captures this piece of reasoning
    implemented by the tactic [xchange]. *)

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars, standard, especially useful (xchange_lemma)

    Prove, without using the tactic [xchange], the following lemma which
    captures the internal working of [xchange]. *)
