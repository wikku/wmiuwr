CPR
CSI 6n
DSR Device Status Report
Reports the cursor position (CPR) by transmitting ESC[n;mR,
where n is the row and m is the column.

If CREAD is set, the receiver is enabled.
Otherwise, no character is received.
Not all hardware supports this bit.
In fact, this flag is pretty silly and if it were not part of the termios
specification it would be omitted.

TCSADRAIN, the change shall occur after all output written to fildes is transmitted.
