unlink() deletes a name from the filesystem.  If that name was
the last link to a file and no processes have the file open, the
file is deleted and the space it was using is made available for
reuse.

If the name was the last link to a file but any processes still
have the file open, the file will remain in existence until the
last file descriptor referring to it is closed.

usuwamy wpis w katalogu
zmniejszamy `links_count` w inode, jeśli 0 to gasimy bit
jeśli w tabeli otwartych plików systemu ten plik nie występuje,
to gasimy bity bloków danych
